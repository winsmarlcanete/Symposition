# Symposition

Symposition is a Java-based 2D music game developed using the LibGDX library. Players arrange musical notes to recreate famous melodies. The gameplay (arranging) is inspired by the bubble sort algorithm, where players swap adjacent notes to achieve the correct order.

This project was developed as a final requirement for CS201A Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis at the Technological Institute of the Philippines

## Features
- desktop application built with Java and LibGDX
- Progressive difficulty per level
- Sound feedback and scoring based on performance (time-based)

## Technologies Used
- Java
- LibGDX
- LWJGL (for sound libraries)
- Tiled Maps

## How to Run
1. Java should be installed
2. Clone the project in the  preferred IDE that supports Gradle
3. Run DesktopLauncher.java

## Gameplay
- Players listen to the original melody
- Musical notes are shuffled
